Neapolitan-style pizza made in home oven, that is actually good.

{{< youtube id="VJu3YCykO_0" >}}

I found this recipe on Brian Lagerstrom youtube channel.

In short:
- 680g all-purpose flour
- 400g water, 30C / 86F
- 8g (one packet) dried yeast
- 15g salt
- 20g sugar
- 20g olive oil

**Measure** all ingredients with kitchen scale.
Mix in large bowl, once combined work the dough with wet hand.
Let it rest for 30 minutes, then fold couple times to build up gluten.
Split it into 4 portions and store in lightly oiled containers.
If you want to cook on the same day, let the dough rest and rise for another 60-90 minutes.
Otherwise, you can keep it in the fridge up to several days. Make sure to take it out 2h before you start cooking to allow the dough to warm to room temperature.

How I bake the pizza:
- I use pizza steel in the oven.
- I heat the oven up to 300C, and let it sit for min. 10 minutes in this temperature before I cook pizza.
- I use the parchment paper (!) - this way pizza does not stick, does not make mess in the oven and I do not need to use extra flour.

Otherwise, my method is very similar to what Brian does.
Toppings - whatever your preference is, I like it Neapolitan-style: tomato sauce, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, olive oil, flaky salt.
