Neapolitan-style pizza made in home oven, that is actually good.

{{< youtube id="VJu3YCykO_0" >}}

This recipe comes from Brian Lagerstrom youtube channel.

For the dough preparation I follow the recipe accurately - I use scale and thermometer to get the right amounts.
Where my approach departs from Brian's:
- I use pizza steel and  keep it in the center of the oven. I do not use broiler.
- I heat the oven up to 300C, and let it sit for min. 10 minutes in this temperature before I cook first pizza.
- I prepare pizza directly on parchment paper without any extra flour, it will not stick and it's easy to get it on the pizza peel and into the oven. Paper gets a bit charred during baking, so keep an eye on it (fire hazard?).
- Because the oven temperature is at 300C, baking time is about 5-6 min.
