This is a recipe for a dumpling dough.

Ingredients:
- 600g flour
- 5g salt
- 250g boiling water
- 50g butter
- 2 eggs

I use stand mixer with a dough hook to mix the ingredients.
Directions:
- Combine flour and salt. Melt butter in water and add to the dough. Start mixing the dough.
- Lightly beat up eggs and gradually add them to the dough while mixing. Continue mixing for the next 5-7 minutes, until the dough has developed some strengt and does not tear up easily while pulling, but rather stretches.
- Wrap the dough in cling film and let it rest for 30 minutes.
- Divide dough into 6-8 pieces, roll it with rolling pin to 2-3mm.
- Cut the wheels using a glass or a cup
- Add filling, fold in half and carefully close the edges, pressing firmly.
- Get a arge pot with salted water into a boil, add dumplings, do not overcrowd the pot, and cook for 2-3 minutes, exact time will depend on dough thickness.
- Take out with a slotted spoon onto a plate on in a bowl, if you plan to store it for later - rinse with cold water to avoid pierogi sticking to each other.
